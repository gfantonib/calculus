This repository contains differentiation and integration python functions.

The differentiation algorithm gives you the maximum and minumum points of a function, including the maximorum and minimorum points.

The integration algorithm gives you the area under a given function on a given interval [a, b].
The Simpson method was used (using trapezois instead of rectangles).

[Here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/tge9bpap) we have a link to a geogebra visual integration calculator.
